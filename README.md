The School Management System (SMS) is a modern, microservices-based platform built using .NET Core and Blazor, designed to streamline core school operations such as pupil registration, fee management, attendance tracking, academic performance, and parent communications. The system is built with scalability and modularity in mind, using containerized microservices orchestrated via .Net Aspire, with a secure API Gateway for centralized access control and routing.

What sets this system apart is its extensive use of AI, embedded directly into various workflows:

🤖 AI-assisted Registration Review: Automatically flags suspicious or incomplete admission submissions based on historical patterns.

🧠 Predictive Analytics: Identifies students at risk of poor performance based on attendance, test scores, and engagement.

✍️ Smart Communication: AI drafts personalized messages to parents and staff for notifications, fee reminders, and academic reports.

📊 Automated Insights: Administrators get AI-generated dashboards summarizing trends, bottlenecks, and actionable recommendations.

This intelligent automation enhances efficiency, improves decision-making, and provides a futuristic edge over traditional school management solutions.
